# Consultation and improvements

After consulting with Pia during scheduled tutorial time, I found out that my design is a little tedious and is not that plausible enough in our daily life. The system should be more meaningful and succinct and I need to fulfill the story behind the whole system.

An possible idea of application given by Pia is about galleries. The warning system can be applied in galleries, not only to avoid deliberate touch and damage from visitors, but also to remind visitors not to break the rules in a polite way.
