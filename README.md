# ASSESSMENT 1 PROPOSAL

My first design is to make a security device. There aretwo levels of warning. When someone crosses the warning line and blocks the spread line of IR generated by the IR transmitter module, the lights will be turned on. Once the touch sensor is touched, the device will automatically make sound using the microphone/buzzer module. There will also be a LCD dot matrix that shows the warning "SOMEONE DETECTED" and a laser module creating a highly focussed red dot.
