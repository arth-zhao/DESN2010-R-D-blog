# Requirements

## **Project No. 1: Transduction Template**

So far we have learned how physical computing can be understood as a series of acts of transduction, transforming one form of energy into another (eg. light into sound etc.). This independent project requires you to use the knowledge you have developed from our deep dives into physical computing topics and methodologies and apply these to create your own design that implements techniques of sensing and actuation. You may choose to incorporate analogue and/or digital components, the minimum requirements being the inclusion of at least one sensor and one actuator. These components are to be developed into a prototype that should take into consideration the phenomena and environment for which they are designed to interpret.

## criterion 1

Create designed objects and experiences that incorporate environmental, behavioural and material factors.

## criterion 2

Navigate and critically interpret physical computing technologies, discourses and practices and apply research to your creative practice.
